      "The purpose of Biz Ops is - to put it in one short phrase - to get money. What that phrase encompasses is more than what it may sound like. Business helps to raise the funds necessary for many things across the board, from the projects to the events to the supplies and materials provided to the students. This entails networking with potential sponsors as well as maintaining relations with current ones, applying to grants and funding, and helping make PiE known both on campus and among corporate sponsors.",

This group works on designing a game that is fair, challenging, and exciting for our high school students. A good game is also exciting and challenging for PiE staff to work on! Join in on tasks like field construction and being a referee. The highlights of Game Implementation are the ease of joining and the large impact we cause. All you need to bring is time to invest and we’ll get you working on projects that are fundamental to the competition. Your handiwork will even be displayed and used by all the high school students.",

For those who have participated in robotics, this experience provides insight on the processes behind creating the mechanical kit. This year we will be improving our previous base kit by introducing new structural pieces. You’ll gain hands-on prototyping experience as we teach you how to use Solidworks, a professional 3-D modeling software, and provide machine shop training. In addition, we’ll explore different robot subsystems. You can build prototypes of lifts, drive trains, and intake mechanisms that will be used to inspire high school students!",

The staff goes through a brainstorming phase to collect ideas on what sensors are required for the game. Then, the sensors are prototyped and then translated into a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). We teach the staff how to use industry level PCB software to route our boards before having our sponsors send us the completed boards. We then manufacture the boards in house to test and revise.",

It has two components, the battery cell voltage display and the actual power distribution. It goes through the same iterative design process as PiE Sens, but has its own project because of its difficulty in power electronics. It has much room to grow because of our partnership with TI as we try to incorporate more of their technologies.",

    description:
      "Shepherd serves as the conductor of PiE competitions. On a high level, field control is very much about interfacing with different sources of information, processing it at a central location, the Shepherd program, and sending commands back to the field/scoreboard. This is one of the larger projects this upcoming season as its goal is to rewrite the entire field control protocol and upgrade it to handle this year’s game. In order to accomplish this, some members on the team will work on developing a scheme for sensors and configuring Arduino controllers to relay information back to Shepherd, some will work on the LCM network protocol that sends commands to each driver station, and some will work on the design and implementation of a new web based UI for displaying score and relevant game information to the teams/audience. Also, as this will be quite a large project involving many different fields of software development, it will be a great opportunity to learn about many of the other projects in PiE and to work with other members outside of just the Shepherd team. Also Sam likes cooking so maybe there’ll be some Shepherd’s Pie at some point or another >:(",
