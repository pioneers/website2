# gatsby-pie

gatsby rework of the pie website

Even if you installed dependancies before for stuff on a different branch its probably a good idea to do it again

## Setup

After pulling the repo install gatsby. `cd` into the folder and run the following:

```elm
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then cd into the pie-website, install dependancies and boot up the server:

```elm
cd pie-website
npm install
npm start
```

Note: this will take a long time probably - there are some fat things to install

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

\_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
